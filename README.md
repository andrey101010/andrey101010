### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Andrey, I have a PhD in analytical chemistry and Data Scientist 

LLM for Company-Tender Matching: I am developing a large language model (LLM) in German to improve the matching of companies with public tenders (Vergabe). The goal is to create a more efficient and accurate system by analyzing complex project and company data.

Digitalization of BauleitplÃ¤ne: My work in computer vision focuses on creating a pipeline to digitize BauleitplÃ¤ne (land-use plans). The system processes these documents and automatically sorts them according to the XPLAN standard, which will significantly improve data management for urban planning.

ISO-Compliant Application: I am leading the development of an application that will adhere to international ISO standards. The project is on track to be completed by the end of 2025, with a focus on meeting all technical and compliance requirements.
