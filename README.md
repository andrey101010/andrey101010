### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Andrey, I have a PhD in physical chemistry and I am specialized on instrumentation development with a strong focus on building analysis pipelines for benchmarking.
- ðŸ”­ So far I have worked with: Python, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Sklearn, Pytorch and Torchvision, Tensorflow and Keras, MLflow, as well as SQL. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning time series with multivariante time series analysis and MLflow  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me how to build analysis pipelines in Python to evaluate the performance of a technical instrument. Also, if you want to know how to model complex physical phenomena, you are in the right place. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
